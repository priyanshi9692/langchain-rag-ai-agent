INDUS WATER TREATY \\nWhy in news? \\nGovernment of India has decided to stop India’s \\nshare of waters in the Indus river system from \\nflowing into Pakistan. \\nAbout the Treaty \\n• \\nIndia and Pakistan, the two main countries in \\nthe Indus basin, divided up rights to the \\nvarious tributaries under the Indus Water \\nTreaty of 1960 brokered by the World Bank. \\n• \\nThough Indus originates from Tibet, China has \\nbeen kept out of the Treaty. \\n• \\nAs per the treaty, control over three eastern \\nrivers Ravi, Beas and Sutlej was given to India. \\nWhile control over three western rivers Indus, \\nJhelum and Chenab was given to Pakistan.  \\n• \\nIt allows India to use only 20% of the water of \\nIndus river, for irrigation, power generation \\nand transport. \\n• \\nThe Permanent Indus Commission (PIC) was \\nset up as a bilateral commission to implement \\nand manage the Treaty. The Commission also \\nsolves disputes arising over water sharing. \\nAdditional Information \\nSir Creek Issue \\n• \\nSir Creek is a 96 km tidal estuary on the border of \\nIndia and Pakistan.  \\n• \\nThe creek, which opens up into the Arabian Sea, \\ndivides the Gujarat state of India from the Sindh \\nprovince of Pakistan \\n• \\nThe dispute lies in the interpretation of the \\nmaritime boundary line between Kutch and Sindh. \\n \\n \\n1.1.2.

Consent is \\nnot required for offences with punishment of \\nmore than seven years of imprisonment or \\ndeath.   \\nDNA or deoxyribonucleic acid \\n• \\nIt is the hereditary material in humans and almost \\nall other organisms. \\n• \\nMost DNA is located in the cell nucleus (where it is \\ncalled nuclear DNA), but a small amount of DNA \\ncan also be found in the mitochondria (where it is \\ncalled mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). \\n• \\nDNA is made up of molecules called nucleotides. \\nEach nucleotide contains a phosphate group, a \\nsugar group & a nitrogen base. The four types of \\nnitrogen bases are adenine(A), thymine(T), \\nguanine(G) & cytosine (C). \\n• \\nDNA is a double helix formed by base pairs \\nattached to a sugar-phosphate backbone. \\n• \\nApplication: \\no \\nIt can almost accurately ascertain the identity \\nof a person, establish biological relationships \\nbetween individuals etc. Thus, useful in \\ninvestigations of crime, identification of \\nunidentified \\nbodies, \\nor \\nin \\ndetermining \\nparentage. \\no \\nIt can also reveal person looks, eye colour, \\nskin colour as well as more intrusive \\ninformation like their allergies or susceptibility \\nto diseases. \\no \\nIt can be used in biometric identification in \\naddition to Iris scanning, Retinal scanning and \\nVoice recognition. \\n \\n \\n1.2. HUMAN MICROBIOME  \\nWhy in news?  \\nIndian Human Microbiome Initiative, led by The \\nNational Centre for Microbial Resource (NCMR) - \\nNational Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) has been \\nput up for approval. \\nMore on news \\n• \\nThe project will include collection of saliva, \\nstool and skin swabs of 20,000 Indians across \\nvarious \\nethnic \\ngroups \\nfrom \\ndifferent \\ngeographical regions.  \\n• \\nScientists have found that Indian population, \\nparticularly \\ntribals, \\nhave \\ndistinct \\ngut \\nmicrobiota.

However, oils with unsaturated fatty acids \\nare healthier provided they are used just once for \\nfrying. \\n5.1.4. TRANS FAT  \\nWhy in News? \\nWorld Health Organization has urged developing \\nnations to eliminate man-made trans fatty acids \\nfrom their food supplies. \\n \\nAbout Trans-Fat \\n• \\nAlso known as Trans Fatty Acids (TFA), they \\nare of 2 types- \\no \\nNatural Trans-Fat- Occur naturally in the \\ndairy and some meat products. \\no \\nArtificial Trans-Fat- They are created \\nwhen the oil goes through hydrogenation, \\nwhich involves adding hydrogen to the \\nliquid oil to make it more solid.   \\n• \\nThey help to increase the shelf life of oils and \\nfoods and stabilise their flavours.  \\n• \\nIn India, Vanaspati, desi ghee, butter and \\nmargarine are the main sources of trans fat. \\nVanaspati is favoured by the industry as it \\nprolongs a food product’s shelf life and is \\ncheap. \\n• \\nThe current permitted level of trans fat is 5 \\nper cent (by weight) in India. FSSAI has \\nfurther proposed to limit the maximum \\namount of trans fat in vegetable oils, \\nvegetable fat and hydrogenated vegetable oil \\nto 2 per cent to make India trans-fat free by \\n2022, a year ahead of the global target by the \\nWHO for complete elimination of trans fat. \\nHealth Hazards due to Trans-Fat \\n• \\nAccording to various studies, a 2% increase in \\nenergy intake from trans-fat has been \\nassociated with a 23 % increase in the risk of \\nheart disease and according to another \\nestimate by WHO. \\no \\nIts consumption increases the risk of \\nheart disease by raising the level of low-\\ndensity lipoprotein (LDL), also known as \\nthe “bad” cholesterol and at the same \\ntime it reduces the level of high-density \\nlipoprotein (HDL) which is the “good” \\ncholesterol.   \\n• \\nThey are supposed to be the main cause of \\nType-2 \\nDiabetes \\nand \\nlinked \\nto \\ninsulin \\nresistance, that is why WHO recommends that \\nno more than one per cent of a person's \\ncalories come from trans fats. \\n“REPLACE” by WHO \\n• \\nWHO has released a step by step guide for the \\nindustry to eliminate trans fats from the food by \\n2023. \\n• \\nThe guide, called REPLACE, has six actions, which \\ninclude  \\no \\nReview of dietary sources of trans fats,  \\no \\nPromoting replacement with healthier fats,  \\no \\nLegislation and Setting up a regulatory \\nframework,  \\no \\nAssessing and monitoring trans fats content in \\nfood,  \\no \\nCreating awareness and  \\no \\nEnforcing regulation.\"),\n",

Every other unit \\nof measurement can be derived from one or more of \\nthese seven units: the unit for speed, for instance, \\nfactors in the units for distance and time. \\n10.2. CALL FOR TWO TIME ZONES \\nIN INDIA \\nWhy in news? \\nCouncil of Scientific & Industrial Research’s National \\nPhysical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL), which maintains \\nIndian Standard Time (IST), has published a research \\narticle describing the necessity of two time zones. \\nNeed for two time zones \\n• \\nAt present, the country observes a single time \\nzone based on the longitude passing through \\n82°30′E. \\n• \\nIndia extends from 68°7’E to 97°25’E, with the \\nspread of 29° representing almost two hours \\nfrom the geographic perspective. Early sunrise \\nin the easternmost parts- (as early as 4AM in \\nJune) in the Northeast - causes the loss of many \\ndaylight hours by the time offices or educational \\ninstitutions open, and that early sunset (4PM in \\nwinters), \\nfor \\nits \\npart, \\nleads \\nto \\nhigher \\nconsumption of electricity. \\n• \\nThe researchers estimated energy savings at 20 \\nmillion kWh if we follow two time zones. This \\nwill have ecological and environmental benefits \\ntoo. \\n• \\nIt will have an impact on circadian rhythm of the \\nbody and thus would have health benefits due \\nto better leisure time and sleep. This, in turn, \\nwould enhance the productivity of people. \\nProposal for new time zone \\n• \\nThe proposed line of demarcation is at 89°52’E, \\nthe narrow border between Assam and West \\nBengal. States west of the line would continue \\nto follow IST (to be called IST-I). States east of \\nthe line — Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, \\nArunanchal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, \\nAndaman & Nicobar Islands —would follow IST-\\nII. \\nRelated Facts \\n• \\nSince independence in 1947, the IST has been the \\nofficial time for the whole country. \\n• \\nIndia’s time zones were first established in 1884. Pre-\\nindependence India had two time zones. In the East, \\nCalcutta Time was 5:30:21 hours ahead of GMT, while \\nBombay Time in the West was 4:51:00 hours ahead of \\nGMT. \\n• \\nCalcutta Time was abandoned in 1948 and Bombay \\nTime in 1955. \\n• \\nAssam already has a Bagaan (tea garden) Time, set an \\nhour ahead of Indian Standard Time (IST).'),\n",

This allows for high-\\nresolution, high-contrast pictures. \\n• \\nWhen X-rays travel through your body, they're \\nabsorbed by denser materials (bones) and pass \\nright through softer ones (muscles and other \\ntissues). The places where the X-rays couldn't \\npass through appear solid white. \\n• \\nInstead of recording the X-rays as either passing \\nright through the body or getting absorbed by \\nthe bone, this scanner is better as it records the \\nprecise energy levels of the X-rays as they hit \\neach particle in your body. It then translates \\nthose measurements into different colours \\nrepresenting your bones, muscles, and other \\ntissues. \\n• \\nThus, it clearly shows the difference between \\nbone, muscle and cartilage and also the position \\nand size of cancerous tumours as well. \\n• \\nOther benefits include: \\no \\nMore accurate diagnosis as it would \\nproduce clearer and more accurate pictures. \\no \\nFuture version may enable complete image \\nof a human, which may help in 3D printing a \\nlost limb or a malfunctioning organ \\no \\nCustomised medical care to individual \\nneeds as it would not just show fractures, \\nsurrounding tissues, blood and nerve supply \\nbut also structures exactly as they are. \\n10.4.

The Act \\ndefines sexual harassment at the workplace \\nand creates a mechanism for redressal of \\ncomplaints.  \\n• \\nThe definition of “aggrieved woman,” who \\nwill get protection under the Act, is extremely \\nwide to cover all women, irrespective of their \\nage or employment status and whether in the \\norganized or unorganized sectors, public or \\nprivate, and covers clients, customers and \\ndomestic workers as well. \\n• \\nThe Act covers concepts of quid pro quo \\nharassment and hostile work environment as \\nforms of sexual harassment if they occur in \\nconnection with an act or behaviour of sexual \\nharassment. \\n• \\nAn internal complaint committee (ICC) is \\nmandatory \\nin \\nevery \\nprivate \\nor \\npublic \\norganisation that has 10 or more employees. \\n• \\nThe Internal Complaints Committee has been \\ngiven powers of a civil court for summoning, \\ndiscovery and production of documents etc. \\n• \\nEach \\nInternal \\nCommittee \\nrequires \\nmembership from an NGO or association \\ncommitted to the cause of women.  \\n• \\nA ‘Local Complaints Committee’ is required to \\nbe constituted in every district by the \\nrespective State government (which will \\nreceive complaints from organizations having \\nless than 10 workers or if the complaint is \\nagainst the employer himself). \\no \\nAn \\nadditional \\n‘Local \\nComplaints \\nCommittee’ shall also be constituted at \\nthe block level to address complaints in \\nsituations where the complainant does \\nnot \\nhave \\nrecourse \\nto \\nan \\nInternal \\nComplaints Committee or where the \\ncomplaint is against the employer himself.  \\n• \\nIt also provides safeguards against false or \\nmalicious charges. \\nAdditional Information \\nCriticism of the Act \\n• \\nThe Act does not cover the agricultural workers \\nand armed forces. \\n• \\nIt is not a gender-neutral legislation and protects \\nonly women from sexual harassment at workplace. \\nSHe-Box \\n• \\nIt seeks to ensure effective implementation of the \\nSexual Harassment of Women at Workplace \\n(Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. \\n• \\nOnce a complaint is submitted to the portal, it will \\nbe directly sent to the ICC/LCC of the concerned \\nauthority having jurisdiction to take action into the \\nmatter. \\n• \\nBoth, Ministry of Women & Child Development \\nMinistry as well as complainant, can monitor the \\nprogress of inquiry. \\n• \\nUsers of SHe-Box also have the option of \\ninteracting with Ministry of WCD through this \\nportal, with an assured time-bound response. \\n1.2.

ADULTERY  \\nWhy in News? \\nThe Supreme Court unanimously struck down \\nSection 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that \\nmakes adultery a punishable offence. \\nCourt’s Stand \\n• \\nSC held that the law was unconstitutional and \\nfell afoul of Article 21 (Right to life and \\npersonal liberty) and Article 14 (Right to \\nequality). It destroys and deprives women of \\ndignity and offends sexual freedom of \\nwomen. \\n• \\nMere adultery can't be a crime unless it \\nattracts the scope of Section 306 (abetment \\nto suicide) of the IPC. It can be ground for civil \\nissues including dissolution of marriage but it \\ncannot be a criminal offence. \\n• \\nThe apex court also declared Section 198(1) \\nand 198(2) of the CrPC, which allows a \\nhusband to bring charges against the man \\nwith whom his wife committed adultery, \\nunconstitutional. \\n1.4.

PATERNITY LEAVE \\nWhy in News? \\nAs per the recent DoPT notification, male \\npersonnel in the central government who are \\nsingle parents to dependent children can now \\navail of child care leave (CCL) of a total 730 days \\nduring their entire period of service, a provision \\nthat till now applied only to women employees. \\nMore on News \\n• \\nChild Care Leave was introduced by the 6th \\nPay Commission. \\n• \\nCurrent \\nmove \\ncomes \\nafter \\nthe \\nrecommendation of the 7th Pay Commission. \\nA single male government employee has been \\ndefined as “an unmarried or widower or \\ndivorcee government servant”. \\nPaternity Leave in India \\n• \\nIn \\nGovernment \\nSector: \\nThe Central \\nGovernment in 1999, by notification under \\nCentral Civil Services (Leave) Rule 551 (A) \\nmade provisions for paternity leave – \\no \\nfor a male Central Government employee \\n(including an apprentice and probationer) \\no \\nwith less than two surviving children \\no \\nfor a period of 15 days to take care of his \\nwife and new born child. \\n• \\nIn private sector: There isn’t any such law that \\nmandates private sectors to provide the \\npaternity leaves to its employees. Some of the \\nmajor MNCs have already taken steps through \\ntheir HR policies such as Microsoft (12 weeks), \\nInfosys (5 days), Facebook (17 weeks), TCS (15 \\ndays). \\nRelated Information \\nMaternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 \\n• \\nIt provides for full paid absence from work for a \\nperiod of 26 weeks (earlier 12 weeks) to take care \\nof the child. \\n• \\nThe Act is applicable to all establishments \\nemploying 10 or more women. \\n• \\nFor women who are expecting after having 2 \\nchildren, the duration of paid maternity leave shall \\nbe 12 weeks. \\n• \\nMaternity leave of 12 weeks to be available to \\nmothers adopting a child below the age of three \\nmonths from the date of adoption as well as to the \\n“commissioning mothers”.  \\n• \\nThe Act makes it mandatory for employers to \\neducate women about the maternity benefits \\navailable to them at the time of their appointment. \\n• \\nAny establishment which has 50 or more \\nemployees shall have the facility of creche.\"),\n",

CLIMATE CHANGE \\n1.1. GLOBAL SCENARIO \\n1.1.1. \\nINTERGOVERNMENTAL \\nPANEL \\nON CLIMATE CHANGE REPORT \\nWhy in news? \\nThe IPCC has released its Special Report titled \\n“Global Warming of 1.5°C”. \\nWhat is the IPCC? \\n• \\nIt was established by the United Nations \\nEnvironment Programme (UNEP) & the World \\nMeteorological Organization (WMO) in 1988 to \\nprovide \\npolicymakers \\nwith \\nregular \\nscientific \\nassessments \\nconcerning \\nclimate \\nchange, \\nits \\nimplications and potential future risks, as well as to \\nput forward adaptation and mitigation strategies.  \\n• \\nIndia is a member. \\nRelated Information \\nHothouse Earth: A situation in which a planet has \\npassed a tipping point (approximately 2 degree Celsius) \\nbeyond which its own natural processes trigger \\nuncontrollable warming. \\nKey findings of the Report \\n• \\nPresent global warming status: Human-\\ninduced global warming in 2017 has already \\nreached 1°C above pre-industrial levels;  \\no \\nSince 2000, the estimated level of human-\\ninduced warming has been equal to the \\nlevel of observed warming due to \\ncontributions from solar and volcanic \\nactivity over the historical period. \\n• \\nImpacts of global warming at 1.5°C: World \\nwould witness greater sea level rise, increased \\nprecipitation \\nand \\nhigher \\nfrequency \\nof \\ndroughts and floods, hotter days and \\nheatwaves, more intense tropical cyclones, \\nand increased ocean acidification and salinity. \\n• \\nImpact of transition from 1.5°C to 2°C:  \\no \\nDecline in crop yields, unprecedented \\nclimate \\nextremes \\nand \\nincreased \\nsusceptibility could push poverty by \\nseveral million by 2050. \\no \\nCoral reefs would decline by 70-90 \\npercent with global warming of 1.5°C, \\nwhereas virtually all (> 99 percent) would \\nbe lost with 2°C. \\no \\nAdditional people could be at risk from \\nmalaria. \\no \\nAbout 350 million additional people could \\nbe exposed to deadly heat waves. \\n• \\nIf global emissions continue as per the \\ncommitments made under Paris Agreement, \\nthe carbon budget (the amount of CO2 that \\nthe world can emit) for 1.5°C warming will be \\nexhausted by 2030.  \\no \\nIn order to limit warming at 1.5°C, the \\nworld will have to reduce CO2 emissions \\nby 45 per cent by 2030 from the 2010 \\nlevels and reach net-zero emissions by \\n2050. \\n1.1.2. EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE \\nON THE OCEAN \\nWhy in News? \\nAccording to a recent study, all oceans in the \\nworld are heating up 60 per cent faster than what \\nIPCC had stated in its Fifth Assessment report.  \\nDetails \\n• \\nAccording to IPCC Fifth Report, world’s \\noceans \\nhave \\nabsorbed \\n90% \\nof \\nthe \\ntemperature rise caused by man-made carbon \\nemissions, while only 1% in the atmosphere. \\n• \\nThe sea level rise (SLR) can impact food \\nsecurity, \\ncreate \\nconflict \\nbetween \\nneighbouring countries and put low lying \\ncountries at risk. Various reports suggest a sea \\nlevel rise of 1 additional metre by 2100. \\n• \\nImmediate effects of SLR include saltwater \\nintrusion of surface waters, increasingly \\nsevere storm surges, submergence and \\nincreased flooding of coastal land. \\n• \\nLonger-term effects of SLR are increased \\nerosion, saltwater intrusion into groundwater \\nand \\na \\ndecline \\nof \\ncoastal \\nwetlands \\n(saltmarshes, mangroves etc.) \\n• \\nSLR endangers freshwater supplies (through \\nsalinization), food yields (through loss of \\narable land) and physical safety (through \\ndamages to coastal infrastructure such as \\nroads, housing and sanitation systems), in \\nseveral low-lying Small Island States and leads \\nto the displacement of people. \\n• \\nIncreasing ocean temperatures and significant \\namounts of melting fresh water may result in \\na slowing of the ocean conveyor belt, altering \\noceanic patterns, changing global weather \\nconditions and disrupting marine food webs. \\n• \\nExtreme weather events: Increasing sea \\nsurface temperatures increase evaporation \\nand atmospheric moisture, creating and \\nfacilitating \\nenvironmental \\nconditions \\nfor'),\n",

DEAD-ZONE  \\nWhy in News? \\nScientist have recently predicted that the dead \\nzone in Gulf of Mexico will become larger.   \\nAbout Dead Zones \\n• \\nDead zones (Hypoxic zones) are areas of the \\nocean (occasionally in lakes and even rivers) \\nwhere oxygen has fallen to such low levels \\nthat most marine life cannot survive. \\n• \\nDead zones are reversible if their causes are \\nreduced or eliminated. \\nCauses \\n• \\nRising sea temperatures-  \\no \\nFor each degree of ocean warming, \\noxygen concentration goes down.  \\no \\nIt causes layers of ocean water to stratify \\nso the more oxygen-rich surface waters \\nare less able to mix with oxygen-poor \\nwaters from the deeper ocean. \\no \\nThe higher temperatures are putting \\nmore stress on marine species, causing \\ntheir metabolisms to speed up and their \\nneed for oxygen to increase. \\n• \\nEutrophication: \\nNutrient \\npollution \\nfrom \\nsources such as sewage. \\n \\n \\nImpacts of Dead Zones \\n• \\nImpact on Global Warming- As Oxygen levels \\nfall, the pace of climate change can \\naccelerate, with low oxygen levels triggering \\nthe release of chemicals like nitrous oxide. \\nThis greenhouse gas is 300 times more \\npowerful than carbon dioxide at trapping \\nheat in the atmosphere. \\n• \\nImpact on Corals-Low oxygen levels can kill \\ncoral reefs. \\n• \\nImpact on Human- due to loss of valuable \\nocean produce. \\n1.2. MITIGATION MEASURES \\n1.2.1. \\nLAND \\nDEGRADATION \\nNEUTRALITY  \\nWhy in news? \\nRecently a session was held at United Nations \\nConvention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) \\nto review the first global assessment of land \\ndegradation which seeks to achieve Land \\nDegradation Neutrality (LDN) by 2030. \\nUnited Nations Convention to Combat Desertification \\n(UNCCD) \\n• \\nAdopted in 1994 and entered into force in 1996, it \\nis \\nthe \\nonly \\ninternationally \\nlegally \\nbinding \\nframework set up to address the problem of \\ndesertification. \\n• \\nThe Convention addresses specifically the arid, \\nsemi-arid and dry sub-humid areas, known as the \\ndrylands. \\n• \\nUNCCD 2018-2030 Strategic Framework has been \\nlaunched to improve the condition of affected \\necosystems, \\ncombat \\ndesertification/land \\ndegradation and to improve the living conditions \\nof affected populations. \\n• \\n2010 to 2020 has been declared as United Nations \\nDecade for Deserts and the Fight Against \\nDesertification. \\nAbout LDN \\n• \\nAs per the UNCCD definition, LDN is a state \\nwhereby the amount and quality of land \\nresources, necessary to support ecosystem \\nfunctions and services and enhance food \\nsecurity, remains stable or increases within \\nspecified temporal and spatial scales. \\n• \\nThe overarching principle for LDN includes: \\no \\nAvoid: \\nBy \\naddressing \\ndrivers \\nof \\ndegradation \\nand \\nthrough \\nproactive \\nmeasures to prevent adverse change in \\nland quality and confer resilience, via \\nappropriate regulation, planning and \\nmanagement practices.'),\n",

CLIMATE ENGINEERING  \\nWhy in News? \\nStratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), a climate \\nengineering method could potentially slow global \\nwarming. \\nClimate Engineering Solutions \\n• \\nClimate \\nEngineering \\nor \\nGeoengineering \\nprojects are designed to tackle the effects of \\nclimate change directly, usually by removing \\nCO2 from the air or limiting the amount of \\nsunlight reaching the planet's surface. \\n• \\nVarious method of Geo-engineering are: \\no \\nGreenhouse gas removal: Examples  \\n✓ Carbon capture and storage (CCS), \\nwhere some of the carbon being \\nemitted by coal-fired power stations \\nis recaptured by physically sucking it \\nin and transporting it elsewhere (like \\noilfields) \\nto \\nbe \\nsequestered \\nunderground. \\n✓ Carbon Capture Utilization Storage \\n(CCUS): It’s a process that captures \\ncarbon emissions from sources like \\ncoal-fired power plants and either \\nreuses or stores it so it will not enter \\nthe atmosphere. \\n✓ In CCS, emissions are forced into \\nunderground rocks at great cost and \\nno economic benefit while CCUS aims \\nat using CO2 emissions by exploiting \\nthe resource itself and creating new \\nmarkets around it. \\n✓ Biochar making: Partly burn materials \\nsuch as logging slash or crop waste to \\nmake \\na \\ncarbon-rich, \\nslow-to-\\ndecompose \\nsubstance known \\nas \\nbiochar, which can then be buried or \\nspread on farmland. Biochar has been \\nused for centuries to enrich the soil \\nfor farming, but of late has been \\ndrawing increased attention for its \\nability to sequester carbon. \\no \\nSolar Radiation Management or Sunlight \\nReflection Methods (SRM): This method \\naims to reduce the amount of heat \\ntrapped \\nby \\ngreenhouse \\ngases \\nby \\nreflecting sunlight back into space, either \\nby increasing the reflectivity of the earth’s \\nsurfaces, or by deploying a layer of \\nreflective particles in the atmosphere. \\n✓ Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI): \\nIt \\ninvolves \\nspraying \\ninto \\nthe \\nstratosphere \\nfine, \\nlight-coloured \\nparticles designed to reflect back part \\nof the solar radiation before it \\nreaches and warms the earth. Sulphur \\nDioxide gas is used for the process. \\n✓ Cirrus cloud manipulation: Here the \\ncirrus clouds are removed or thinned \\nso that their long-wave trapping \\ncapacity is reduced and thus cools the \\nsurface. \\n✓ Marine cloud brightening: The low \\nwarm \\nclouds \\nwhich \\nare \\nhighly \\nreflective to sunlight are modified to \\nincrease their reflectivity.  \\n✓ Space sunshade: Obstructing sunrays \\nwith space based mirrors. \\n✓ Using pale-coloured roofing material \\nor growing high albedo crops.\"),\n",

COMMUNITY FOREST RESOURCE \\nWhy in news? \\nRecently, People’s Forests Report was released by \\nCentre for Science and Environment (CSE) on \\nCommunity Forest Resource (CFR) management.  \\nBackground \\n• \\nNational Forest Policy, 1988, led to the \\nemergence of joint forest management \\n(JFM), leading to increased availability of non-\\ntimber forest produce (NTFPs), fuelwood and \\nimproved forest protection. \\n• \\nIn 2006, The Scheduled Tribes and Other \\nTraditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of \\nForest Rights) Act or the Forest Rights Act \\n(FRA) was passed which provides for \\nrecognition of forest lands as community \\nforest resources (CFR).  \\nJoint Forest Management (JFM) Vs Community \\nforest resource (CFR) management \\n• \\nThe primary and most significant basis for \\nJFM is provided by the National Forest Policy \\nof 1988. Thus, it lacks any statutory sanctity \\nunlike CRF which is a right recognised under \\nthe FRA, 2006.  \\n• \\nUnder JFM, both forest department and the \\nlocal \\ncommunity \\nform \\na \\nJoint \\nForest \\nManagement Committee (JFMC) and an \\nexecutive committee to manage and protect \\nforests by sharing the cost and benefits. \\nHowever, CFR management committees \\n(CFRMCs) comprise members exclusively \\nfrom the gram sabha with no representation \\nof forest or other officials with 100% authority \\nover collection and sale of all NTFPs. \\nForest Right Act 2006: It provides for a rights-based, \\ndemocratic and decentralized governance of forests. \\nRights recognized under FRA. \\n• \\nIndividual forest rights (IFR) to legally hold \\nforestlands that the forest dwelling communities \\nhave been residing on and cultivating prior to 13 \\nDecember 2005. \\n• \\nCommunity rights (CRs) of ownership, use and \\ndisposal of ‘minor forest produce’, also known as \\nnon-timber forest produce (NTFP). CRs include \\nrights of grazing, collection of firewood, fish and \\nother such products from water bodies, as well as \\nrights to biodiversity and intellectual property, \\nincluding those related to traditional knowledge. \\n• \\nCommunity forest resource (CFR) rights under \\nSection 3(1)(i) to protect, regenerate, conserve or \\nmanage forest resources for sustainable use, \\nproviding for community governance of forests. \\n• \\nEligibility to get rights under the Act is confined to \\nthose who \"primarily reside in forests\" and who \\ndepend on forests and forest land for a livelihood. \\nFurther, either the claimant must be a member of \\nthe Scheduled Tribes scheduled in that area or \\nmust have been residing in the forest for 75 years.  \\n• \\nThe Act provides that the gram sabha, or village \\nassembly, \\nwill \\ninitially \\npass \\na \\nresolution \\nrecommending whose rights to which resources \\nshould be recognised. \\nAbout CFR \\n \\n• \\nCFR rights is the most empowering provision of \\nthe Act because it restores gram sabha’s [village \\ncouncil] control over governance of forests from'),\n",

NATIONAL POLICY ON BIOFUELS-\\n2018 \\nWhy in news? \\nRajasthan has become the first State in the \\ncountry to implement the national policy on \\nbiofuels. \\nAbout Biofuels  \\nBiofuel is any hydrocarbon fuel that is produced \\nfrom organic matter in a short period of time. \\nDifferent generations of biofuels: \\n• \\nFirst Generation Biofuels: It uses the food \\ncrops like wheat and sugar for making ethanol \\nand oil seeds for bio diesel by conventional \\nmethod of fermentation. \\n• \\nSecond Generation Biofuels: It uses non-food \\ncrops and feedstock such as Jatropha, wood, \\ngrass, seed crops, organic waste. \\n• \\nThird Generation Biofuels: It uses specially \\nengineered \\nAlgae \\nwhose \\nbiomass \\nis \\nconverted into biofuels.  \\n• \\nFourth Generation biofuel: It aims at not only \\nproducing sustainable energy but also a way \\nof capturing and storing CO2. \\nDifferent types of Bio Fuels \\n• \\nBio ethanol: It is an alcohol produced from \\nfermentation of carbohydrate and cellulosic \\nmaterial of crops and other plants and \\ngrasses. It is generally used as an additive to \\nincrease octane number of fuel. \\n• \\nBio Diesel: It is a methyl or methyl ester of \\nfatty acids produced by trans esterification of \\noils and fats obtained from plants and \\nanimals. It can be directly used as fuel. \\n• \\nBio gas: Biogas (primarily a mixture of \\nmethane and other gases like CO2 and N2) is \\nproduced by anaerobic digestion of organic \\nmaterials. It can be produced either from \\nbiodegradable waste materials or by the use \\nof energy crops fed into anaerobic digesters \\nto supplement gas yields. \\n• \\nBiojet: It is a type of biofuel which are \\nproduced from biomass resources and used in \\nplace of, or blended with air turbine fuel. \\no \\nRecently, India’s first ever bio-jet fuel \\nflight taken off by using the fuel \\ndeveloped by the CSIR-Indian Institute of \\nPetroleum (IIP). \\nSalient Features of the National Policy on \\nBiofuels, 2018  \\n• \\nCategorisation \\nof \\nbiofuels \\nto \\nenable \\nextension of appropriate financial and fiscal \\nincentives under each category. The two main \\ncategories are: \\no \\nBasic Biofuels- First Generation (1G) \\nbioethanol & biodiesel. \\no \\nAdvanced Biofuels - Second Generation \\n(2G) ethanol, Municipal Solid Waste \\n(MSW) to drop-in fuels, third Generation \\n(3G) biofuels, bio-CNG etc.  \\n• \\nThrust on Advanced Biofuels: Viability gap \\nfunding scheme for 2G ethanol Bio refineries \\nin addition to additional tax incentives and \\nhigher purchase price as compared to 1G \\nbiofuels. \\n• \\nExpands the scope of raw material for \\nethanol production: by allowing use of \\nsugarcane juice, sugar containing materials \\nlike sugar beet, sweet sorghum, starch \\ncontaining materials \\nlike \\ncorn, cassava, \\ndamaged food grains like wheat, broken rice, \\nrotten \\npotatoes, \\nunfit \\nfor \\nhuman \\nconsumption for ethanol production. \\n• \\nAllows use of surplus food grains for \\nproduction of ethanol for blending with \\npetrol to ensure appropriate price to farmers \\nduring surplus. However, it needs the \\napproval of National Biofuel Coordination \\nCommittee \\n(headed \\nby \\nthe \\nMinister, \\nPetroleum and Natural Gas). \\n• \\nEncourages setting up of supply chain \\nmechanisms for biodiesel production from \\nnon-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil, short \\ngestation crops. \\n• \\nSynergising efforts by capturing the roles and \\nresponsibilities of all the concerned Ministries/ \\nDepartments with respect to biofuels in the \\npolicy document itself. \\nRelated Information \\nInternational Energy Agency (IEA)  \\n• \\nIt was founded in 1974 to help countries \\ncollectively respond to oil supply disruptions.  \\n• \\nIt is an autonomous body within the OECD \\nframework.  \\n• \\nOnly \\nthe \\nOECD \\nmember states can \\nbecome \\nmembers of the IEA. \\n• \\nIndia is not a member but has joined IEA as an \\nassociation country. \\n• \\nIt publishes the World Energy Outlook (WEO).'),\n",

Of these, Zone V is \\nseismically the most active region, while \\nzone II is the least.  \\n• \\nNational Centre for Seismology (NCS) has \\ncategorized the unusual tremors as an \\n‘earthquake swarm’. \\n• \\nEarthquake swarms can occur through the \\nprocess of Reservoir Induced Seismicity (RIS) \\nwhen large amount of seismic energy gets \\nconcentrated in a small area due to the \\nweight of the large structure and the water \\nthat it holds. \\n• \\nHydro-seismicity is being hypothesized as the \\nreason for swarms in peninsular India.  \\no \\nWater from heavy rainfall enters the small \\nfractures in the rocks creating pressure \\nbetween them.  \\no \\nWith every 10 meter rise in groundwater, \\npore pressure increases by 1 bar. This \\npressure is released in the form of \\nearthquake swarms. \\nEarthquake swarm \\n• \\nIt is a series of low magnitude earthquakes that \\noccur in a localized region and over a period of \\ntime ranging from days, weeks to even months.  \\n• \\nBut earthquake swarms are not limited to the \\nPeninsula. In 2016, a series of 58 earthquakes were \\nrecorded in the Rampur area of Himachal Pradesh. \\nThis Himalayan swarm was attributed to low \\nstrength of the earth’s crust in the area which \\ncould not hold the tectonic energy. \\n5.4.

Such notification \\nshould also indicate the level of severity of the \\ndrought (moderate or severe). \\nAccording to the National Commission on Agriculture \\nthe 3 types of droughts are: \\n• \\nMeteorological drought: This happens when the \\nactual rainfall in an area is significantly less than \\nthe climatological mean of that area. \\n• \\nHydrological drought: A marked depletion of \\nsurface water causing very low stream flow and \\ndrying of lakes, rivers and reservoirs. \\n• \\nAgricultural drought: Inadequate soil moisture \\nresulting in acute crop stress and fall in agricultural \\nproductivity.  \\n• \\nIMD can define a meteorological drought, but \\nagricultural and hydrological droughts are different \\nand states are better equipped to declare them.'),\n",

KELP FORESTS \\nWhy in News? \\nAccording to a recent study, Climate change could \\nlead to decline of underwater kelp forests. \\n \\nAbout Kelps \\n• \\nThey are large brown algae seaweeds. They \\ngrow in \"underwater forests\" (kelp forests) in \\nshallow oceans.    \\n• \\nGenerally speaking, kelps live further from \\nthe tropics than coral reefs, mangrove \\nforests, and warm-water seagrass beds.  \\no \\nAlthough kelp forests are unknown in \\ntropical surface waters, a few species \\nhave been known to occur exclusively in \\ntropical deep waters. \\no \\nKelps and coral reefs are composed of \\nalgae that grow in the shallow parts of the \\nocean in warm and sunny waters. \\nHowever, kelp forest grows in nutrient-\\nrich waters while corals can develop in \\nlow nutrient waters. \\n• \\nThe environmental factors necessary for kelp \\nto survive include hard substrate (usually \\nrock), high nutrients, clear shallow coastal \\nwaters and light.  \\n• \\nThe productive kelp forests tend to be \\nassociated \\nwith \\nareas \\nof \\nsignificant \\noceanographic upwelling.    \\n• \\nThey are known for their high growth rate. \\nSome varieties grow as fast as half a metre a \\nday, ultimately reaching 30 to 80 metres. \\n• \\nKelp forests are recognized as one of the \\nmost productive and dynamic ecosystems on \\nEarth. Smaller areas of anchored kelp are \\ncalled kelp beds. \\nImportance of Kelp Forests \\n• \\nThey are considered as Keystone Species and \\ntheir removal is likely to result in a relatively \\nsignificant shift in the composition of the \\ncommunity and perhaps in the physical \\nstructure of the environment. \\n• \\nIt provides as an important source of food for \\nmany marine species. In some cases, up to \\n60% of carbon found in coastal invertebrates \\nis attributable to kelp productivity. It may be \\nconsumed directly or colonised by bacteria \\nthat in turn are preyed upon by consumers.'),\n",

POLAR VORTEX \\nWhy in news? \\nRecently, US mid-west experienced sub-zero \\ntemperatures due to a breakdown in the polar \\nvortex.  \\nWhat is a polar vortex?  \\n• \\nIt is a large area of low pressure and cold air \\nsurrounding the Earth’s North and South \\nPole.  \\n• \\nThe term refers to the counterclockwise flow \\n(clockwise over south pole) of air that helps \\nkeep the colder air close to the poles. \\n• \\nThere are not one but two polar vortexes in \\neach hemisphere.  \\no \\nOne exists in the lowest layer of the \\natmosphere, \\nthe \\ntroposphere. \\nThe \\ntropospheric polar vortex is the one that \\naffects our weather.  \\no \\nThe other exists in the second-lowest, \\ncalled the stratosphere. It is much more \\ncompact \\nthan \\nits \\ntropospheric \\ncounterpart.  \\no \\nIf the two polar vortexes line up just right, \\nvery deep freeze conditions may occur.  \\n• \\nThe boundary of the polar vortex is really the \\nboundary between the cold polar air to the \\nnorth, and the warmer sub-tropical air \\n(considering Northern Hemisphere). And that \\nboundary is actually defined by the polar \\nfront jet stream- a narrow band of very, very \\nfast-moving air, moving from west to east.  \\n• \\nBut that boundary shifts all the time. It shrinks \\nin summer, pole-ward while in winter, the \\npolar vortex sometimes becomes less stable \\nand expands, sending cold air southward with \\nthe jet stream. This is called a polar vortex \\nevent (“breaking off” of a part of the vortex). \\n• \\nThe break in polar vortex appears to be linked \\nto the long and chilly winter in the north India \\nthis year. \\n \\n \\nWhy cold air plunges south (in Northern \\nHemisphere)? \\n• \\nGreenhouse gas emissions has amplified \\nArctic warming resulting into dramatic \\nmelting of ice and snow in recent decades, \\nwhich exposes darker ocean and land surfaces \\nthat absorb a lot more of the sun’s heat. \\n• \\nBecause of rapid Arctic warming, the north-\\nsouth temperature difference has diminished. \\nThis reduces pressure differences between \\nthe Arctic and mid-latitudes, weakening jet \\nstream winds which tend to meander. \\n• \\nLarge north-south undulations in the jet \\nstream \\ngenerate \\nwave \\nenergy \\nin \\nthe \\natmosphere.
