Machine learning is a subfield of AI where computers learn to 
    identify patterns and make decisions from data without being explicitly 
    programmed for every task. It involves feeding data into algorithms to train models, 
    which can then make predictions or classify new, unseen data. 
    This allows systems to improve their performance as they are exposed to 
    more data and are used in applications like image recognition, fraud detection, 
    and personalized recommendations.
